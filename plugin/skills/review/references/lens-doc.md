# Lens: Document Review

Rubric for reviewing specifications, implementation plans, PRDs, technical designs, or other requirement documents. Load this reference when running `andthen:review --mode doc` or when the Mixed mode's doc sub-pass runs.


## Scope

Specs, FIS, PRDs, plans, ADRs, design docs, prompts, or other written artifacts. Locate the document(s) or focus area from arguments or context. Build context: project type, stage, goals, constraints, existing patterns, and any related docs. Read extra docs only when they materially affect correctness.

Favor **proportional review** — a prototype, library, or MVP should not be judged like an enterprise platform. Favor simplicity — flag over-engineering and recommend the smallest solution that meets the real need.


## Review Dimensions

Review the document through these lenses and record only issues relevant to the project's scale:

- **Completeness**: functional requirements, important non-functional requirements, integrations, edge cases, testing, and operations where applicable
- **Clarity**: vague language, contradictions, missing details, inconsistent naming, unclear acceptance criteria, or unclear implementation handoff
- **Technical accuracy**: outdated APIs, deprecated approaches, infeasible designs, missing standards alignment. When the document names concrete frameworks, APIs, libraries, or version-bound patterns, verify claims against authoritative documentation (use the `andthen:documentation-lookup` agent if available)
- **Scope and architecture**: explicit in/out-of-scope boundaries, phase boundaries, architecture soundness, and signs of disproportionate complexity
- **Stakeholder fit**: user needs, success criteria, UX/error-state coverage

If the document is a FIS, verify it still follows the structure and intent-first authoring rules from [`fis-authoring-guidelines.md`](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/fis-authoring-guidelines.md).


## Critic Sub-Lens (Always On)

Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/lens-adversarial.md` against the document as an always-on sub-lens. Attack ambiguous requirements, missing unhappy paths, hidden implementation guesses, contradiction-prone terminology, and places where an implementer would have to infer behavior not stated in the artifact.

Merge Critic findings into the normal document review findings before calibration and filtering. Do not treat the Critic as a separate mode or an optional escalation.


## Calibration

Calibrate severity with `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/review-calibration.md` (universal) and `doc-review-calibration.md` (doc-specific). Load `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/critic-calibration.md` while running the always-on Critic sub-lens; use the document-specific calibration to assign final severity after findings are collected. Use the unified severity scale defined in `review-verdict.md`: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW.


## Findings Filter

This pass cannot find new issues; that is the Critic Lens's job (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/lens-adversarial.md`).

Run the full Findings Filter only when any finding is Critical OR total findings > 5. Otherwise apply an inline self-check: re-read each finding against calibration examples and adjust severity. Withdrawals follow the same Verdict-discipline floor as the formal filter ([`adversarial-challenge.md`](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/adversarial-challenge.md)) — concrete falsifier required; "doesn't hold up" alone is a downgrade. Add one line: "Applied inline severity calibration (Findings Filter skipped: no Critical findings and <=5 total)."

**Full filter** (when triggered): Use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/adversarial-challenge.md` (`Generic Findings-Filter Template`) with:
- **Role**: `Findings Filter reviewing document review findings`
- **Shared calibration**: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/review-calibration.md`
- **Skill calibration**: `doc-review-calibration.md`
- **Context block**: `Document type, path, project scale/stage context from discovery.`
- **Questions**: Is this a real gap given project scale? Is severity proportional? Is it addressed elsewhere? Would it mislead or block implementation?
- **Verdicts**: `VALIDATED`, `DOWNGRADED`, `WITHDRAWN`
- **Findings payload**: `{all findings}`

Apply verdicts before writing the final report.


## Findings Output

Use the unified severity scale from `review-verdict.md`: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW.

**Readiness label**: `Ready` / `Needs Minor Updates` / `Needs Significant Rework` / `Not Ready` — per the verdict reference (doc-mode readiness scale preserved).


## Downstream Routing

After producing findings, classify the dominant pattern and name the right downstream skill in the report's **Recommended Next Action** section.

**Document maturity signal** — distinguishes "draft" from "mature" via concrete markers, in priority order:
1. PRD — always draft for routing purposes (its job is to be clarified into a plan/spec)
2. Plan or FIS with a `Status:` field whose value is pre-execution (e.g. `draft`, `ready-for-review`, `ready-for-execution`) — draft until the value indicates execution has started or completed
3. Plan with no story checkboxes ticked, or FIS with no implementation work landed in the codebase — draft
4. Otherwise — mature

**Pattern precedence** — a single document can match more than one pattern; apply the first that fires:
1. **Requirement-gap cluster** — any "unanswered question / undefined behavior" finding (regardless of severity), OR ≥2 Completeness / Stakeholder Fit findings at MEDIUM or higher. Fires only on draft documents (per maturity signal). Route → the `andthen:clarify` skill. The answers don't exist yet; mechanical edits would paper over the gap. Phrase the recommendation concretely, naming both the gap areas and the doc path, e.g. *"Significant requirement gaps in <areas> in `<doc-path>` — run `andthen:clarify` against `<doc-path>` to resolve them before re-running spec/exec."*
2. **Defect cluster** — clarity, technical accuracy, structural/anchor defects. Route → the `andthen:remediate-findings` skill (or let `--fix` invoke it). Fixes are mechanical edits to the doc.
3. **Mature spec/FIS with requirement-fit concerns** — same triggers as the requirement-gap cluster but on a mature document. Route → the `andthen:remediate-findings` skill. Re-running the `andthen:clarify` skill on a near-final FIS produces churn; encode the concerns as targeted edits instead.

**Interactivity contract** — this reference states which branch is interactive; the `SKILL.md` `FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS` step owns the gate. The clarify branch is interactive by nature (the `andthen:clarify` skill cannot run headless), so:
- Under `AUTO_MODE=off`, the SKILL.md `FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS` step prompts the user to run the `andthen:clarify` skill inline against the listed gaps.
- Under `AUTO_MODE=on`, the recommendation appears only in the report's **Recommended Next Action** — never prompt and never invoke the `andthen:clarify` skill automatically. The orchestrator decides.


## Report Sections

## Executive Summary
Overall assessment, high-level findings, Findings Filter stats, key recommendations

## Scope and Context

## Completeness Analysis

## Clarity Issues

## Stakeholder Alignment

## Prioritized Recommendations
Critical / High / Medium / Low

## Readiness Assessment

## Recommended Next Action
One line. Name the specific skill (`andthen:clarify`, `andthen:remediate-findings`, or none), the doc path, and the trigger pattern. Do **not** duplicate the Prioritized Recommendations list — this section records the routing decision, not the findings. Per **Downstream Routing** above.

## Report Output Conventions

Filename and directory resolve per [`review-report-location.md`](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/review-report-location.md). This lens contributes:
- **`<feature-name>` token**: the spec/FIS/PRD/plan name (e.g. `payments-prd`, `s03-checkout-fis`)
- **Report suffix**: `doc-review` (canonical source: the `andthen:review` skill's mode table)
- **Target nature**: doc artifact. Tier-2 "next to target" remains enabled — when no spec directory resolves, doc reviews co-locate with the document under review.
